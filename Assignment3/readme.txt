 Normalization and plots have been done for each, in question implementation

Question1 :

1.2) refer to Question1.py file
1.3) all deliverables for BreastCancer, Diabetes and Spambase dataset are in 'Question1Output' folder
     I am varying the values for tolerance and learning rate (as can be seen in the commented postion of the code) for different values
	and for each I am plotting min loss and average accuracy score.
	I am selecting the tolerance for whom the loss is minimum, and learning rate for whom the accuracy score is maximum.
	I am selecting the no of iterations by varying learning rate and tolerance over a no of values and printing the loss array for each value for any 1 fold.
	On an average for the learning rate and tolerance combination I select, I am finally chosing max no of iterations as 1000 say for example in Cancer data
1.4) refer to Assignment 3 q1.4.pdf

Question 2 :

2.4) refer to Question2.py and Question2Multi.py files for Bernoulli and Multinomial programs respectively.
2.5) refer to 'Question2BernoulliOutput' and 'Question2MultinomialOutput' files for the output plots
2.6) refer to 'Assignment 3 q2.6.pdf'
