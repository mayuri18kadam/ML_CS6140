Matlab/Octave
Below is a processed version of the 20news-bydate data set which is easy to read into Matlab/Octave as a sparse matrix:
20news-bydate-matlab.tgz
You'll find six files:
train.data
train.label
train.map
test.data
test.label
test.map
The .data files are formatted "docIdx wordIdx count". The .label files are simply a list of label id's. The .map files map from label id's to label names. Rainbow was used to lex the data files. I used the following two scripts to produce the data files:
lexData.sh
rainbow2matlab.py
[Added 1/14/08] The following file contains the vocabulary for the indexed data. The line number corresponds to the index number of the word---word on the first line is word #1, word on the second line is word #2, etc.
