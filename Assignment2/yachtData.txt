Data Set Information:

Prediction of residuary resistance of sailing yachts at the initial design stage is of a great value for evaluating the ship’s performance and for estimating the required propulsive power. Essential inputs include the basic hull dimensions and the boat velocity. 

The Delft data set comprises 308 full-scale experiments, which were performed at the Delft Ship Hydromechanics Laboratory for that purpose. 
These experiments include 22 different hull forms, derived from a parent form closely related to the ‘Standfast 43’ designed by Frans Maas. 


Attribute Information:

Variations concern hull geometry coefficients and the Froude number: 

1. Longitudinal position of the center of buoyancy, adimensional. 
2. Prismatic coefficient, adimensional. 
3. Length-displacement ratio, adimensional. 
4. Beam-draught ratio, adimensional. 
5. Length-beam ratio, adimensional. 
6. Froude number, adimensional. 

The measured variable is the residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement: 

7. Residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement, adimensional.
